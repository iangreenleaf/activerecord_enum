# Native ENUM types in ActiveRecord #

Provides ActiveRecord (and thus Rails) support for the nonstandard `ENUM` and `SET` data types.

## How now? ##

It sucks to have ActiveRecord not understand your `ENUM` columns and constantly write the wrong thing to your `schema.rb`.
It also sucks to work with a database that uses `ENUM` in production when you'd prefer sqlite in development.
Wait no longer...

```ruby
create_table :balloons, :force => true do |t|
  t.enum "color", :limit => ['red', 'gold'], :default => 'gold', :null => false
  # or...
  t.column "size", :enum, :limit => ['small', 'medium', 'large']
end
```

Your schema<->db coupling will work again, and it will fall back to a `VARCHAR` column on any adapters that don't support `ENUM`.

## Installation ##

```
gem 'native_enum'
```

Make sure to put this line *after* the line for your database adapter gem, like so:

```
gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.3.20'
gem 'native_enum'
```

That's it!

## Hypothetically asked questions ##

### Y U NO WORK?! ###

It currently works with:

 * ActiveRecord 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, and 5.1.
 * The `mysql2` and `sqlite` adapters.
 * Ruby 2.0 and above.

If you'd like to support other adapters, pull requests are welcome!

### I thought Rails 4.1+ did enums? ###

This gem provides compatibility for *native* `ENUM` types in the DB.
[ActiveRecord::Enum](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Enum.html) is actually a layer that takes an integer column in the DB and *presents* it as an enum type.
These are fundamentally different approaches, with different motivations, costs and benefits.

### Why doesn't it validate anything? ###

Following ActiveRecord's lead, this plugin doesn't do any validation work itself.

For ENUM columns, you may be satisfied with something simple:

    validates_inclusion_of :attr, :in => [ :possible, :values ]

Or if you prefer more bells and whistles, try [brainspec/enumerize](https://github.com/brainspec/enumerize).

For SET columns, you may be interested in [iangreenleaf/active_set](https://github.com/iangreenleaf/active_set).

### Nonstandard SQL?! What's your problem, jerkweed? ###

This isn't a plugin everyone should use. There are a number of plugins to simulate enum behavior backed by standard data types. Personally, I like [nofxx/symbolize](https://github.com/nofxx/symbolize).

However, sometimes we can't or won't avoid working with these data types. When that happens, I got you covered.
